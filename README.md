## Questions

1. List top 5 courses by year-over-year percent enrollment growth from Fall 2022 to Fall 2023. Year-over-year percent enrollment growth is defined as (enrollment in Fall 2023 - enrollment in Fall 2022) / enrollment in Fall 2022. Enrollment is defined as any course enrollment resulting in any final grade. Do not include any courses where Fall 2022 enrollment was 20 or less in this calculation.
2. Is there a difference in the course success rates among demographic groups (fictitious demographic groups)? Analyze the data and discuss your finding. For the purpose of this exercise, course success rate is defined as (number of grades that are A, B, C, or P) / (number of enrollment as defined in the previous question).
3. For terms Fall 2021, Fall 2022, and Fall 2023, calculate the course succcess rates for each course section of subject Mahjong Strategy (fictitious subject). Then, create a static visualization (e.g. chart, graph, table, etc.) of the result of this question, conveying something that you find noteworthy in the data. Assume that your visualization is to be used in a written communication to the department chair and the Dean overseeing the department in Mahjong Strategy. There is no right or wrong answer to this question, and this task is aimed at understanding how you convey the results of your work to stakeholders. You can do this exercise using any tools you'd like, Excel, Google Sheets, Python, R, or any other tools.
